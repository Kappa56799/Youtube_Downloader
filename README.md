<h1 align="center">Youtube_Downloader</h1>

<p> A Youtube Downloader made in python by myself :). I used pytube to get and download the videos, customtkinter to create the GUI and lastly moviepy to convert the video from mp4 to mp3. It uses only python and pip to function but it can be converted to an exe using auto-py-to-exe or pyinstaller to make it an exe or elif. Was made to practice and learn new python libraries!</p>
